# Octodex REST API

[![Automated API tests using Postman CLI](https://github.com/jonico/octodex-rest-api/actions/workflows/postman.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonico/octodex-rest-api/actions/workflows/postman.yml)

There is no official REST API for the [Octodex ](https://octodex.github.com) \- GitHub's home of Octocat illustrations and the place where superfans can find and share their favorite designs.

JSON is so much easier to work with than HTML, so why not create your own Octodex REST API that returns JSON? We have already created a Postman [API Mock Server](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/) and copied all the tests and visualizations created by Postman in this request. Once you have created your real backend, just replace the value of the `baseUrl` collection variable with the URL of your own server and run the tests again.

If you are interested in how you can design your own APIs with Postman, version them in GitHub, include CI/CD and generate server boilerplate code, [check out Postman's documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/).
